# Introduction to UCSF Geriatrics Github Code Repository
This is how UCSF Geriatrics will use Github to construct and publish their analysis coding repositories.

Purpose:
- Create a valuable learning resource for our PIâ€™s, MSTAR students, Fellows, and support staff who are increasingly invested in learning more about data analysis to become better researchers
- Adhere to transparency, reproducibility, and practice good science principles as we contribute more new knowledge into the greater scientific community

Criteria for GitHub Manuscript Repository:
-	code needs to be generalizable so please minimize hard coded lines so users can incorporate this into their own analyses
example: 
NHATS NSOC provide SAS and Stata Programming Codes have been made publicly available for this purpose: https://www.nhats.org/scripts/TechnicalDementiaClass.htm

-	remove instances of unique cases (especially if they refer to patient data)

-	for code used to generate figures/tables:
please format it as a stand-alone code file
within the top of the file, document name of statistician, publication citation, and which table/figure that this code corresponds to, what is the data source it points to, and note restriction, such as if data is unavailable for distribution due to data usage agreements
for major steps, if not already indicated, please have a comment indicated for each section of code (ie: what this step is for, how it fits into the analysis, how it manipulates the dataset)

-	Verify and check that the code runs correctly (same results as publication) before we upload it into GitHub
